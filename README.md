Open `index.html` in your browser to play.

You can run the index files in browser's, but I only have used Firefox mostly for rendering testing. Opera's GX browser runs testing really fast, press ESC to start it and check console with shift-control-c. 

I have a Word doc "Team Poker" Please read for further details on gameplay.
