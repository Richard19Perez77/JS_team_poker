Consider keeping div or html elements out of methods with JS
    1. can allow js code to be tested headless
    2. allow for div elements and html elements to be tested without worrying about js global variables being altered

Remove the code from libarary...
Without generics or libraries can you pass a <div> and add image then check the image was loaded?
    Can this be done without the UI?
    Will making it hidden have the same effect as a unit test?

Why not rely on libraries?
    Keep code from breaking on import of whole project
    New updates can break code in working project

Challenge to not use libraries is not obvious to people.
Removing JQuery can force the code to be written in different order of page loading and finished loading
