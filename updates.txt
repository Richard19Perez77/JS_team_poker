updates fill out documentation
add images
don't give away the logic all the way
make gameplay updates public in repo
allow normal people to fork and update
laugh at it already laughed at
chop up team members into different people
unless the same situation will always appear to them
more than one round passing breaks the game by throwing off 
for player, i consider that a bummer but whatever... i like it
its not cheating its your game
its a style that lends itself to cheap but is it fun
fun is cheap have it
have a cookie, you'll feel better
if possible never die fully without comedy
fargon war
better quote 
stating news is not hate
card war... stripped down version of ff8 game
fargon war.. stripped down veersion of games
update war... need updates
vanilla seems to nail it, why give them the chance to 
fix whatever they failed at
document then update it
software at its best
don't redocument
humanity at its best
AI writing code
lies
chatboxes... its real people behind the AI 
don't be fools
